    <h1>What is Artful CSS?</h1>
    <p>Artful CSS is a founding principle of Innova Futura. Put simply, Artful CSS is the expression of feeling, emotion, and ideas through the design of websites. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Artful CSS contains 4 principles. Here they are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Be Creative and Express Diversity of Design. If you were looking at paintings in an art museum, and every painting looked exactly the same, you probably would end up hating all the paintings. Similarly, websites should not look exactly the same as other websites. Having a diverse collection of websites in the world will benefit each website. Our eyes and brains like to see variety.</li>
        <li> Convey an accent. Make the website relate to your topic. For example, make the colors based on the colors associated with what you are trying to convey. For example, eco-friendliness is often associated with the color green. Because of this, making more content's color green could help make the website look better.</li>
        <li>Don't make it bland. Sometimes, people don't have enough experience with CSS or are too scared to do something with the CSS that they do know. At Innova Futura, students will learn 50 of the most useful and simple CSS properties, and will have the confidence to use it.</li>
        <li>"Oh please, save my eyes before they dies!" This phrase, coined by a master of CSS design, accurately describes one mistake; people try so hard to make a website include CSS that the CSS ends up looking ugly. At Innova Futura, students will learn to avoid mistakes that make webpages look horrible. </li>
        <li></li>

    <p>Notice how this example webpage does not use much of the Artful CSS properties. This webpage does look quite bland (Principle #3)* and also includes CSS that does not look very good (Principle #4)* However, at the time that this website was created, it had one of the best CSS designs, partly because at that time, CSS was quite new and not as developed as CSS today. Compare this to The apple website today:</p>
