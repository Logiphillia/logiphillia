							KIDS LEARN CODING

					</h1>
				
				<br><br><br>
				<p>Innova Futura is an online coding class currently serving ages 8 - 13. We plan to teach HTML and CSS, languages
					used for creating websites, to those who want to learn it. Learning with us is completely free. All teachers at
					Innova Futura are people younger than 18 years old that want to teach other children the basics of programming,
					but we do so in a friendlier, less boring way than many other programming courses. We know that people learn best
					face-to-face, but we also believe that all people should have a right to learn to code. To solve this, we use
					video calls to teach. We also have a specific way of teaching.
					Innova Futura, part of LogicaPhillia (LogiPhillia) was founded on January 23, 2024 by Sathvik Pedumajji and Vismai Nair. The Pilot Class is set to begin on February 4th, which is also when enrollment ends.

			<h1>WHY <span class="highlight">IS PROGRAMMING RELEVANT?</span></h1>
			<p>Programming is a skill regarded by many to be important, but regarded by many others to be useless. They argue
				that since there are so many companies that provide free drop-and-drag website interfaces, programming is useless.
				Is it useful, and if so, how much? This article was created by Innova Futura School.</p>
