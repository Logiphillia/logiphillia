  <h2>Why Innova Futura? Our Beliefs</h2>
  <p>
    You may be wondering why Innova Futura is better than other programming classes such as freecodecamp.com or
    codecademy.com. The answer lies in the human desire to have a human teaching them. In the 1950s, a newspaper called
    "USA Today" was released. This newspaper contained more pictures and less words, which actually made it sell better.
    During the COVID-19 crisis, may students were forced to learn from home, which inhibited their learning progress
    because the teachers could not help them. Questions are also critical for learning. The human brain is hardwired to
    think and ask questions: this is one of the main things that sets us apart from monkeys. However, in many other free
    coding platforms, the students can't ask questions unless they are thirteen or older. Two more things that we
    strongly believe in is collaboration in learning. At most schools, students typically only do a very small amount of
    collaborative projects, even though collaboration is a very important real-world skill. At Innova Futura, learning
    is intertwined with collaboration: when students do in-class practice, they are almost always working together.
    Lastly, we believe in practice. Often, students can't practice their skills and get help with their projects, which
    is why 40 minutes in class is devoted to practicing the skills that Innova Futura students learned prior to the
    practice. As a result, we've come up with a class structure that allows students to practice, collaborate, and
    learn. At Innova Futura, we believe that exploration is the key to learning.

  <h2>Class Structure</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Students learn the lesson. They are free to ask questions at any time during the lesson. This takes around 20 minutes of the class.
    </li>
    <li>Students complete a task related to the lesson. They are placed in groups of students, and the students may ask
      the teacher questions. This typically takes 40 minutes of the class.
    </li>
    <li> If there is extra time, the teacher may let the students work on any programming-related project that they can
      make. They may ask any questions.

    </li>
  </ol>
