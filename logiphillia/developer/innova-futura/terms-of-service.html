		<h1>Terms Of Service</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome, and thank you for your interest in LogicaPhillia (“Innova Futura School,”, "LogiPhillia", "LogicaPhillia", "Logiphillia" “we,” “us,” or "our"), which operates the web site located at https://innova-futura.vismainair.repl.co and other websites (collectively, the “Website”) and related application programming interfaces (“APIs”), mobile applications and online services, including, but not limited to, the Innova Futura School Portal and related applications, any Downloadable Content (as defined below), and any other products and services that we may provide now or in the future (collectively, the “Services”).  The following Terms of Service are a legal contract between you (“you” and “your”) and regarding your use of the Services.  Visitors and users of the Services are referred to individually as “User” and collectively as “Users”.  Use of the Services is governed by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy (as applicable to which Services you choose to use), where the Privacy Policy describes the personal information that we collect and how we use and share it.
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. BY REGISTERING FOR, ACCESSING, BROWSING, OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND ANY ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES (AS DEFINED BELOW) (COLLECTIVELY,  THE “TERMS”), AND THAT YOU HAVE READ THE PRIVACY POLICY (AS APPLICABLE TO WHICH SERVICES YOU CHOOSE TO USE).
IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU PROVIDE CONSENT FOR YOUR CHILD TO REGISTER WITH THE WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN RESPECT OF SUCH CHILD’S USE OF THE WEBSITE.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS INCLUDE A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, INCLUDING A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.</p>
<h2> 1. Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
			<p>
				By Registering an account for the Services, you represent that your registration has been approved by US resident at least 18 years of age. You also represent that you have not been previously suspended or removed from the Services by Innova Futura School, and that your registration and your use of the Services is in compliance with any and all applicable state and federal laws, rules, and regulations. Also, by registering and account, you allow any person that works directly for the state government, federal government, or volunteers at Innova Futura School to permanently terminate your account.
			</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			In order to use certain features of the Services, you must register for an account. You may be asked to provide a password in connection with your account.  You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password.  You agree that the information you provide to Innova Futura School, whether at registration or at any other time, will be true, accurate, current, and complete.  You also agree that you will ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times.  If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (e.g., in the event of a loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of your account ID or password), then you agree to immediately notify Innova Futura School by emailing vismai.nair@gmail.com. You may be liable for any losses incurred by Innova Futura School or others due to any unauthorized use of your Services account.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Innova Futura School users may need accounts other than those required for usage of the Innova Futura School Services. By registering with Innova Futura School, you agree that you will register for those accounts when we request that you register for them. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			If you are under the age of 13 (a "Child User"), you may not create or register an account for the Services without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian.  If you are under the age of 18, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the Terms on your behalf. A Child User that begins the registration process for himself or herself without a Parent User (as defined below) may have the registration process restricted until a parent approves or assumes responsibility for the Child User account.  A Child User will only be permitted to use the Services for so long as Innova Futura School reasonably believes that such access has been consented to by the Child User’s parent or guardian.
			If a Child User is found to not have the consent and approval of their legal guardian or parent, their account may be terminated at the discretion of any Innova Futura School volunteer. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			If you are at least 18 years of age and you are the legal parent or guardian of a child that seeks to register as a Child User of the Services, you may register a parent account on the Services (“Parent User”).  Through a Parent User account, you may create, register, manage and approve Child User accounts only for your own child(ren) or child(ren) for whom you are a legal guardian.  IF YOU REGISTER, APPROVE OR CONSENT TO THE REGISTRATION OF, OR OTHERWISE ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CHILD USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE SUCH CHILD USER’S LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE WEBSITE BY THE CHILD USER.  You acknowledge that Innova Futura School may choose, but is not obligated, to make any inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that Innova Futura School deems necessary to validate your registration information, including without limitation engaging third parties to provide verification services.  Innova Futura School reserves all rights to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INNOVA FUTURA SCHOOL CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY ANY USER AND INNOVA FUTURA SCHOOL IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF ANY USER, INCLUDING ANY USER’S CLAIM TO BE A PARENT USER, OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY A CHILD USER OR OTHER PARTY DURING REGISTRATION IS SUCH CHILD USER’S ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN.  A Parent User account, along with all associated Child User accounts, may be terminated by Innova Futura School at any time and without any warning for any failure to abide by these Terms.

Your continued use of the Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.  For any material changes to the Terms, Innova Futura School will make reasonable effort to provide notice to you of such amended Terms, such as by an email notification to the address associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Services, and such amended terms will be effective against you on the earlier of (i) your actual notice of such changes and (ii) seven days after Innova Futura School makes a reasonable attempt to provide you such notice.  However, changes addressing new functions for a service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately.  If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must immediately discontinue your use of the Services. Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the version of the Terms in place at the time the dispute arose. Disputes will be resolved by the current head of Innova Futura School.
